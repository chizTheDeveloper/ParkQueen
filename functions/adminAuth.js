// Centralized fresh-admin authorization for privileged callables.
//
// Prior pattern (still used only by bootstrapAdmin's own distinct bootstrap
// contract) was:
//
//   if (request.auth?.token?.role !== 'admin') throw new HttpsError('permission-denied', ...);
//
// This trusts only the PRESENTED ID TOKEN's embedded claims. Firebase ID
// tokens are bearer credentials that remain cryptographically valid for
// their full lifetime (normally ~1 hour) regardless of what happens to the
// account afterward. A token-only check does not notice:
//   - the caller was demoted (admin -> staff/null) after the token was minted
//   - the caller's Auth account was deleted after the token was minted
//   - the caller's Auth account was disabled after the token was minted
//   - the caller's refresh tokens were explicitly revoked after the token was minted
// setStaffRole's and deleteAccount's own target-side hardening (the shared
// adminRoleLock, the last-admin scan) protects the ACCOUNT BEING ACTED ON —
// it does nothing to stop a demoted/deleted/disabled/revoked CALLER from
// using their own still-valid old token to invoke admin-gated callables in
// the first place. requireCurrentAdmin closes that gap by re-deriving
// authorization from current server-side Auth state on every call, not the
// token alone.
//
// Revoked-refresh-token enforcement (isTokenRevokedForUser below) mirrors
// firebase-admin's OWN algorithm exactly — see BaseAuth.
// verifyDecodedJWTNotRevokedOrDisabled in
// node_modules/firebase-admin/lib/auth/base-auth.js (installed version
// 12.7.0 at the time this was written): it compares
// `decodedIdToken.auth_time * 1000` (NOT `iat` — auth_time reflects the
// original sign-in and stays constant across token refreshes tied to that
// session, which is exactly why Firebase uses it for revocation, not iat)
// against `new Date(userRecord.tokensValidAfterTime).getTime()`, and treats
// strictly-less-than as revoked (equal is valid). The callable framework's
// own automatic auth population (checkAuthToken in
// firebase-functions/lib/common/providers/https.js, installed version
// 5.1.1) calls `verifyIdToken(idToken)` with no checkRevoked argument
// (defaults to false) — confirmed by direct source read, not memory — so
// request.auth.token is a verified-but-revocation-unchecked decoded token,
// and request.auth.token.auth_time is the exact same field the SDK's own
// check uses. No raw bearer token re-parsing is needed to reproduce this
// comparison server-side.
//
// A prior version of this file attempted true revocation via
// getAuth().verifyIdToken(token, /* checkRevoked= */ true) against a raw
// bearer token pulled from request.rawRequest, and was removed after a
// direct diagnostic against the Firebase Auth EMULATOR proved the emulator
// does not enforce tokensValidAfterTime (a revoked token was still
// accepted). That was a real, valid reason not to ship an emulator-provable
// implementation — but the underlying algorithm is fully documented in the
// installed Admin SDK's own source and requires no raw-token parsing at
// all: it only needs request.auth.token.auth_time (already present) and
// getUser(uid).tokensValidAfterTime (already fetched by the existing
// fresh-state check below). This version implements that exact comparison
// directly, verified against SDK source and covered by deterministic
// boundary tests (see functions/adminAuth.revocation.integration.test.js) rather than
// relying on emulator behavior that is known not to exercise it.
//
// Lazy-require Firebase modules so this file is importable from test envs
// without requiring Firebase Admin to be initialized (matches rateLimiter.js).

// Pure, side-effect-free — exported for direct deterministic boundary
// testing without needing a live Auth emulator (which cannot exercise this
// path at all; see header above).
//
// Mirrors firebase-admin's BaseAuth.verifyDecodedJWTNotRevokedOrDisabled
// revocation comparison exactly, with two deliberate, documented
// deviations for privileged-endpoint safety (the raw SDK fails OPEN in
// both of these edge cases; a privileged endpoint must not):
//   - decodedToken.auth_time missing/non-numeric: every legitimately
//     Firebase-issued ID token carries this claim; its absence is not part
//     of any normal flow. The raw SDK would compute `undefined * 1000 ===
//     NaN`, and `NaN < x` is always false in JS, silently treating the
//     token as never-revoked. We fail closed instead.
//   - userRecord.tokensValidAfterTime present but unparseable: structurally
//     unreachable via the public UserRecord getter (firebase-admin's own
//     constructor guarantees this field is always either undefined or a
//     successfully Date-parsed string — see
//     node_modules/firebase-admin/lib/auth/user-record.js's parseDate),
//     but defensive regardless. The raw SDK would compute
//     `new Date(malformed).getTime() === NaN`, and any comparison against
//     NaN is false, again silently failing open. We fail closed instead.
//   - userRecord.tokensValidAfterTime absent entirely: this IS the SDK's
//     own documented "never revoked" representation (revokeRefreshTokens
//     has never been called for this account) — NOT an error condition.
//     Matches SDK semantics exactly: not revoked.
function isTokenRevokedForUser(decodedToken, userRecord) {
    const validAfter = userRecord.tokensValidAfterTime;
    if (!validAfter) {
        return false; // never revoked — legitimate default representation, matches SDK
