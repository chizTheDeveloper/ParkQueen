/**
 * Atomically cancels a claimant's claim on a Ping.
 *
 * Firestore transactions require every tx.get() to run before the first
 * tx.update()/tx.set()/tx.delete() — violating that order throws "Firestore
 * transactions require all reads to be executed before all writes." at
 * commit time. This function performs exactly one transactional read (the
 * spot) before any write, which trivially satisfies that ordering.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT also read the deterministic cancellation-notification
 * doc to check whether it already exists: spotNotifications reads are
 * owner-only (`resource.data.targetUserId == request.auth.uid`), so the
 * claimant has no read access to a notification addressed to the Ping
 * owner — attempting that read throws permission-denied. Idempotency is
 * instead derived entirely from the spot's own state:
 *
 *   - The notification is only ever written in the same atomic commit as
 *     the claim-field clear, by this exact function, keyed on
 *     (spotId, claimStartedAt). No other code path writes that id.
 *   - Once a claim's fields are cleared, `claimStatus(...).matches` is false
 *     for any later call with the same fingerprint — so a lost-response
 *     retry always resolves to `already_resolved` before it would ever
 *     attempt to write again.
 *
 * A permission-denied on commit does NOT automatically mean "someone else
 * already resolved it" — it could also mean this claim is still fully
 * intact and something else about the write was rejected (e.g. a stray
 * notification doc already occupying this exact deterministic id). Treating
 * every denial as success would silently misreport a genuine failure as a
 * completed cancellation. So on denial, re-read the spot *outside* the
 * failed transaction and classify from what's actually true now:
 *   - claim is gone/cleared by someone else  -> already_resolved
 *   - a different claimant now holds it      -> stale_claim
 *   - the same claim is still fully active   -> rethrow (genuine failure)
 *   - the re-read itself fails               -> rethrow the original error
